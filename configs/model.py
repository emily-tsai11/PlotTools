# How a shape variation relates statistically to the nominal:
#
#   "independent" : separate MC sample (CR1/CR2/tune_CP5)
#   "migration"   : same events, jets/MET recomputed, events move between bins
#   "correlated"  : same events, same kinematics, only the event weight changes
#
# For "independent", var(varied - nominal) = var_nom + var_syst is exact. For the
# other two the shared events cancel in the difference and the exact variance is
# NOT recoverable from the stored sumw2 of the two histograms -- it needs
# sum(w^2 (r-1)^2), which is only available at fill time (see COMBINE_FIXES.md).
#
# So the default here is deliberately conservative: use var_nom + var_syst for
# every class. That over-estimates the uncertainty on the shift, hence
# under-estimates its significance, so a variation is only ever dropped when it
# is compatible with zero even under an inflated error. The Barlow form for
# nested samples, |var_syst - var_nom|, is available but is not obviously better
# here: for a small weight variation it goes to zero and the significance
# diverges.

    For a weight-based variation neither var_nom + var_leg nor |var_leg -
    var_nom| estimates var(leg - nom): both overestimate it by orders of
    magnitude (factors 2/eps^2 and 2/eps for a variation of relative size eps).
    Neither is recoverable from the stored sumw2 alone -- the exact quantity is
    sum(w^2 (r-1)^2), available only at fill time.

    What is recoverable is the scatter of the ratio r = leg/nom around a smooth
    curve. Second differences kill any linear trend, so the MAD of
    r[i+1] - 2 r[i] + r[i-1] measures noise and not structure. The sqrt(6)
    normalises the second difference of independent points to a per-point sigma.

    Two properties matter and were both wrong before:
      * the second difference must use ADJACENT bins. Taken on the compressed
        array it leaps over empty bins, and that step is structure, not noise.
      * the ratio noise scales as 1/sqrt(n_eff), so a single flat relative error
        is wrong. Each second difference is divided by its own 1/sqrt(n_eff)
        factor, which leaves one dimensionless constant c, and the per-bin
        variance is then  var_i = c^2 * nom_i^2 / n_eff_i.
        With n_eff_i = nom_i^2 / var_nom_i this is  var_i = c^2 * var_nom_i.
